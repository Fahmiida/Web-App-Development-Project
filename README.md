# Project Proposal: buy&beautify


# Problem Statement

With the increasing range and creativity in the makeup world, the search for the right makeup
products and tutorials fitting individual tastes can be a burdensome task. Customers often incur
challenges in choosing the right products and mastering the application of these products. This
often leads to disappointment and wastage of time. Especially Bangladesh, one of the
developing nations, has been modernizing the society at a very high speed. They have
come a long way from a horrible revolutionary period trying to reach a stage of a
western world. Therefore, they need support in every sector from every corner of the
nation and what could be more beneficial than their fashion and makeup industry as
well. With that in mind, we are constructing this website “buy&beautify” to enhance even
